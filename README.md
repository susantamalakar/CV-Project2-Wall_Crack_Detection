# CV-Project2-Wall_Crack_Detection
Description:

This is a small basic computer vision project on wall crack detection and highlighting. This system will allow you to change the threshold in real time so that you can based on your application you can check the smallest to highest holes and cracks. In this project, the system will allow you to browse and select an image or a video from your computer and then it will detect if the wall image has crack or not. If it detects any crack or whole it will make the cracked pixels value '0' so it will look black and the surrounding pixels will be colored red. If the whole image is colored red and only a few areas are black it is easy to find the cracks for big pictures.
follow the instructions to implement the system.
